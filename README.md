# PicFall
Picfall.com - a twitter picture viewer (out-of-date, python, gae, jquery)

My first python project, built in 2009 as an experiment with Google app engine and the Twitter API.

It presented the pictures

I stopped working on it due to other projects and now it doesn't work (for many reasons)
 - Twitter's API changed
 - Twitter's API changed again
 - Twitters rules about what a twet should look like changed (couldn't get away with just showing images any more)
 - The old image sharers (twitpic & yfrog) were pushed out
 - Google App Engine retured soem of the features it was using.
 
You probably don't want to use this as a base for any new work.
